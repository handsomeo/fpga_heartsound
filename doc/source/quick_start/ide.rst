How to develop with Nuclei Studio(Ver.2020-09)
==============================================

This chapter will introduce how to run Hello World demo on HBirdv2 E203 SoC with Nuclei Studio.

Nuclei Studio introduction
##########################

Nuclei Studio is an integrated development environment(IDE) developed by `Nuclei System Technology <https://nucleisys.com>`__ to support its self-developed processors(including commercial Nuclei series processors and open source HBird E203 processor). It's implemented based on the open source Eclipse framework, and fully integrated with Nuclei SDK(for commercial Nuclei series processors) and HBird SDK(for open source HBird E203 processor). Users could easily create new projects and modify project settings based on their requirements with Nuclei Studio. 

Install Nuclei Studio
#####################

Nuclei Studio could be downloaded from `Nuclei Download Center <https://nucleisys.com/download.php>`__.

   Nuclei Studio download 

.. note::
   
   - Nuclei Studio is available in Windows and Linux, here just take Nuclei Studio(Ver.2020-09) for Windows as example.
   - Nuclei Studio Ver.2022-04 and subsequent verison support new features(NPK), and the development flow is different with old verison, so if using Nuclei Stuido with 2022-04 or subsequent verison, please refer to :ref:`How to develop with Nuclei Studio(Ver.2022-04) <ide_latest>`.

Etract the downloaded package, there are three parts, shown in the figure below.

- NucleiStudio: Nuclei Studio IDE. 
- SerialDebugging_Tool: Serial Debugging tool for Windows.
- HBird_Driver.exe: HBird Debugger driver for Windows.

     Hello World Demo Result 


Debug Hello World Project
#########################

**1. Hardward connection**

- Same as **Step1** in :ref:`Run Hello World demo with HBird SDK<quickstart_run_hello_world>`.

**2. Debugger driver install**

- Same as **Step2** in :ref:`Run Hello World demo with HBird SDK<quickstart_run_hello_world>`.

  .. note::
     
     Debugging program need to set download mode as "ILM", since the newly created **Hello World** project already sets "ILM" as default download mode, so we don't need to do any changes before compiling. If the download mode has been changed by yourself, please make sure it should be set to "ILM" when you want to debug program.
