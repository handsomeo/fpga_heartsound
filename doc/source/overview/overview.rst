Introduction
############

The Hummingbirdv2 E203 RISC-V processor core and SoC is developped and opensourced by `Nuclei System Technology <https://nucleisys.com>`__, the leading RISC-V IP and Solution company based on China Mainland.

It's an upgraded version of the project Hummingbird E203 maintained in `SI-RISCV/e200_opensource <https://github.com/SI-RISCV/e200_opensource>`__, so we called it Hummingbirdv2 E203 (HBirdv2 E203). The system architecture of Hummingbirdv2 E203 is shown in the block diagram below.

   System architecture of Hummingbirdv2 E203

In this new verison, we have following updates.

- Add NICE(Nuclei Instruction Co-unit Extension) for E203 core, so user could create customized HW co-units with E203 core easily.
- Integrate the APB interface peripherals(GPIO, I2C, UART, SPI, PWM) from `PULP Platform <https://github.com/pulp-platform>`__ into Hummingbirdv2 SoC, these peripherals are implemented in Verilog language, so it's easy for user to understand.
- Add new development boards(Nuclei ddr200t and mcu200t) support for Hummingbirdv2 SoC.
